Documentation for Taskwarrior can be found using 'man task', 'man taskrc', 'man task-color', 'man task-sync' or at https://taskwarrior.org

The general form of commands is:
  task [<filter>] <command> [<mods>]

The <filter> consists of zero or more restrictions on which tasks to select, such as:
  task                                      <command> <mods>
  task 28                                   <command> <mods>
  task +weekend                             <command> <mods>
  task project:Home due.before:today        <command> <mods>
  task ebeeab00-ccf8-464b-8b58-f7f2d606edfb <command> <mods>

By default, filter elements are combined with an implicit 'and' operator, but 'or' and 'xor' may also be used, provided parentheses are included:
  task '(/[Cc]at|[Dd]og/ or /[0-9]+/)'      <command> <mods>

A filter may target specific tasks using ID or UUID numbers.  To specify multiple tasks use one of these forms:
  task 1,2,3                                    delete
  task 1-3                                      info
  task 1,2-5,19                                 modify pri:H
  task 4-7 ebeeab00-ccf8-464b-8b58-f7f2d606edfb info

The <mods> consist of zero or more changes to apply to the selected tasks, such as:
  task <filter> <command> project:Home
  task <filter> <command> +weekend +garden due:tomorrow
  task <filter> <command> Description/annotation text
  task <filter> <command> /from/to/     <- replace first match
  task <filter> <command> /from/to/g    <- replace all matches

Tags are arbitrary words, any quantity:
  +tag       The + means add the tag
  -tag       The - means remove the tag

Built-in attributes are:
  description:    Task description text
  status:         Status of task - pending, completed, deleted, waiting
  project:        Project name
  priority:       Priority
  due:            Due date
  recur:          Recurrence frequency
  until:          Expiration date of a task
  limit:          Desired number of rows in report, or 'page'
  wait:           Date until task becomes pending
  entry:          Date task was created
  end:            Date task was completed/deleted
  start:          Date task was started
  scheduled:      Date task is scheduled to start
  modified:       Date task was last modified
  depends:        Other tasks that this task depends upon

Attribute modifiers make filters more precise.  Supported modifiers are:

  Modifiers         Example            Equivalent           Meaning
  ----------------  -----------------  -------------------  -------------------------
                    due:today          due = today          Fuzzy match
  not               due.not:today      due != today         Fuzzy non-match
  before, below     due.before:today   due < today          Exact date comparison
  after, above      due.after:today    due >= tomorrow      Exact date comparison
  none              project.none:      project == ''        Empty
  any               project.any:       project !== ''       Not empty
  is, equals        project.is:x       project == x         Exact match
  isnt              project.isnt:x     project !== x        Exact non-match
  has, contains     desc.has:Hello     desc ~ Hello         Pattern match
  hasnt,            desc.hasnt:Hello   desc !~ Hello        Pattern non-match
  startswith, left  desc.left:Hel      desc ~ '^Hel'        Beginning match
  endswith, right   desc.right:llo     desc ~ 'llo$'        End match
  word              desc.word:Hello    desc ~ '\bHello\b'   Boundaried word match
  noword            desc.noword:Hello  desc !~ '\bHello\b'  Boundaried word non-match

Alternately algebraic expressions support:
  and  or  xor            Logical operators
  <  <=  =  !=  >=  >     Relational operators
  (  )                    Precedence

  task due.before:eom priority.not:L   list
  task '(due < eom and priority != L)'  list

The default .taskrc file can be overridden with:
  task ... rc:<alternate file> ...
  task ... rc:~/.alt_taskrc ...

The values in .taskrc (or alternate) can be overridden with:
  task ... rc.<name>=<value> ...
  task rc.color=off list

Any command or attribute name may be abbreviated if still unique:
  task list project:Home
  task li       pro:Home

Some task descriptions need to be escaped because of the shell:
  task add "quoted ' quote"
  task add escaped \' quote

The argument -- tells Taskwarrior to treat all other args as description, even if they would otherwise be attributes or tags:
  task add -- project:Home needs scheduling

Many characters have special meaning to the shell, including:
  $ ! ' " ( ) ; \ ` * ? { } [ ] < > | & % # ~
